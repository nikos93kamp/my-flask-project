# my-flask-project

A blog style flask app, where different users can write different posts. This can be like blog post or they can be Twitter updates. Also we have an authentication system for login, logout and register actions. New users can create a new account and new posts. These who are already users can login to their existing account, reset their password if they forget it and send them an email, which have the link for creating a new password. Finally the users can update their profile by username, email and image profile picture.
